# About me:
I am a young programmer, I program purely for myself, not counting on earnings or fame, but my projects are not bad enough to use them every day. I am a Russian speaker, so I write README files through Google Translator. I am quite religious, Orthodox, I believe that Moscow is the Third Rome, and there is no place for communists in Russia. I'm currently looking for experienced developers for my Third System project, a Unix-like operating system that will be written completely from scratch. I love the old skeuomorphic design like in MacOS X 10 or Windows 7. I use the Oxylite icon theme. I know the details of the x86 architecture quite well. 
I'm writing my own WM from scratch - [AquaWM](https://github.com/SirAsus/aquawm "WM is still in development, so there may be nothing in the repository.")
